Hey Listeners, it’s Reid.
We’re sharing with you today the Graduation Episode,
in honor of all our recent grads
and anyone navigating a big life decision.
On Masters of Scale, we talk a lot about how businesses grow.
But we also talk about how people grow:
How key decisions shape your future.
And how setbacks can set you up for future success.
This special episode is hosted by Jordan Harbinger.
Jordan’s podcast distills wisdom from brilliant people
and helps listeners live what they’ve learned.
For this show, Jordan chose clips from Masters of Scale
that capture unexpected life lessons.
Then he interviewed me about what we can learn from them.
